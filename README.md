> Why are fewer documents generally returned in phrase query mode than in intersection query mode? 

In a sense phrase query is more strict than intersection query. The phrase `a query` consists of the words `a` and `query`, which may both be present in a document, but must not necessarily be right next to each other in intersection mode.

Difficult cases: majors with courses in mathematics. Are we looking for documents about majors in mathematics, or majors with math courses?
Some documents describe people having a degree in mathematics living in davis, or have a graduate, and know mathematics. Are they relevant?

### 1.6  

### First query
`mathematics graduate uc davis`

27 documents, too many to categorize. (too broad query)

### Second query
`mathematics graduate major uc davis`
When talking about graduate education, the word major often also comes up, so it may yield narrower results.

### Third query

`mathematics math graduate major uc davis`
Should one look for something related to mathematics, articles tend to use mathematics and maths more interchangeably, thus one can search for both at once in an intersection query.

> Why can we not simply set the query to be the entire information need description?  
Because computers don't understand natural language as humans do. Asking *How do I travel from London to Paris via train?* to Google will probably yield very relevant results, in many cases were *travel*, *London*, *Paris* and *train* are frequent, and not because the search engine understood your query (what you were "asking"). 

### 1.7
PostingsLists saved as

And each entry is saved as

### 1.8

The reason the query `queen of england` yields 364 (out of 364) matches in intersection query mode, but only 6 (out of 7) in phrase query mode, may be because of how the tokenizer works. Let's say that we have the phrase `queen of<england>` in the document, then the tokenizer may translate this to `queen`, `of`, `<`, `england` and `>`, where queen of england is no longer a contiguous phrase. 

### 2.4

Difficult case: documents with two or three words and a redirect, are they relevant or not?
